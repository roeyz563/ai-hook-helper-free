5.  **CRITICAL:** A pop-up will show your new key. It will start with `sk-`. **Copy this key immediately!** You will not be able to see it again. Paste it into a secure note on your computer or phone.
6.  New accounts receive **$5.00 of free credit**, which will last a very long time for this tool.

**You're all set! Now go back to the app and paste your key into the sidebar.**

Do I need to pay?
Most new users receive $5.00 of free API credit to start, with no payment required.
Occasionally, OpenAI may ask for a one-time small payment (usually ~$5) to activate your account and prevent fraud. If asked, this payment will be added to your account as usable credit.
In either case, you will have credit to use. Generating hooks costs just pennies, so this will last a very long time.
